# Tags

`Cloud Storage` `File Upload` `Javascript` `front-end`

# Demo

You can try to use `clam` demo web application on [https://hacknock.github.io/clam-example/](https://hacknock.github.io/clam-example/)

# Advantages

The past libraries to upload files to Cloud Storage only support back-end frameworks such as Node.js. On the other hand, this library is a "front-end" library to help you develop a front-end application that needs a function to upload files.

# Installation

```html
<script 
  type="text/javascript"
  src="https://rawcdn.githack.com/Hacknock/clam/1.4.0/clam.min.js"
></script>
```

```js
const clam = new Clam();
```

# Minimal Example

We open the minimal example code to the public on [Hacknock/clam-example](https://github.com/Hacknock/clam-example). Please refer there. This source code is a [demo site](https://hacknock.github.io/clam-example/) of `clam`.
